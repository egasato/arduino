## 02 - Spaceship Interface Project
This projects consists in building the interface of a spaceship using a little
bit of electronics, coding and papercraft. The interface is pretty simple, it has two different states:
* One LED (green) is turned on and the other two (red) turned off.
* One LED (green) is turned off and the other two (red) blink alternately every 250 microseconds.

The state can be toggled using a pressure sensor (a button, duh!) and once the two LEDs (red) have
blinked the state resets back.

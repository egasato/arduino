## 03 - Love-O-Meter
This project consists in building a love-o-meter, that is to say, a simple
temperature measuring program (also called a thermometer).
The setup consists in three LEDs that serve as a feedback to know approximately
the measured temperature. The temperature is measured using a TMP36 temperature
sensor (which is bundled in the Arduino Starter Kit) and the read values can be
seen in the serial monitor once the board has been connected to the computer.
## Setup
